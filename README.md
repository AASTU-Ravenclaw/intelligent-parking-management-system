# Intelligent Parking Management System (IPMS)

## Project Overview
The Intelligent Parking Management System (IPMS) is a simple prototype developed as part of the **Software Configuration Management (SCM) Mini Project** for the Department of Software Engineering.  
The project demonstrates the practical application of **SCM principles** such as configuration identification, version control, change management, baselining, release management, and configuration audits.

The functional scope of the system is intentionally minimal. The primary focus of this project is **configuration management processes**, not programming complexity.


## System Description
IPMS is designed to conceptually support a floor-based parking system based on vehicle type (car, van, truck).  
For SCM demonstration purposes, the implemented prototype includes:

- A login/authentication page
- A main dashboard page
- Basic parking allocation logic
- A simple data store using a JSON file


## Repository Structure

The repository follows the structure required by the assignment:
